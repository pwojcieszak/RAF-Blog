            <h2>Hawker Hunter</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Hunter, the first jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the Royal Air Force, entered service as an interceptor aircraft. It displayed exceptional performance right from the start, capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber, and even set various aviation records, including absolute speed records. The Hunter was celebrated for its quick turnaround time, made possible by features like the removable gun pack and pressurized fuelling system, as well as its ease of handling in flight.
            </p>

                The FGA.9 was the definitive version of the Hunter, forming the basis for the majority of export variants. Despite initial political favoritism toward the Supermarine Swift by the British Government, the Hunter proved to be far more successful. Its extended service life with various operators was attributed to its low maintenance requirements and operating costs, while the Swift program was canceled in 1955.

                The Hunter went to war in the Suez Crisis of 1956 (also known as the Tripartite Aggression), when Anglo-French-Israeli forces tried to thwart Egyptian attempts to decide the use of Egyptian waterways. Hunter F.5s of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort missions in support of Canberra bombers attacking Egypt. The Hunters lack of range made them ill-suited for the mission and they were accordingly reassigned to local air defence.
